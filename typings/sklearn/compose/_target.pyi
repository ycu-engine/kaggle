class TransformedTargetRegressor(RegressorMixin, BaseEstimator):
    """Meta-estimator to regress on a transformed target.

    Useful for applying a non-linear transformation to the target ``y`` in
    regression problems. This transformation can be given as a Transformer
    such as the QuantileTransformer or as a function and its inverse such as
    ``log`` and ``exp``.

    The computation during ``fit`` is::

        regressor.fit(X, func(y))

    or::

        regressor.fit(X, transformer.transform(y))

    The computation during ``predict`` is::

        inverse_func(regressor.predict(X))

    or::

        transformer.inverse_transform(regressor.predict(X))

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <transformed_target_regressor>`.

    .. versionadded:: 0.20

    Parameters
    ----------
    regressor : object, default=None
        Regressor object such as derived from ``RegressorMixin``. This
        regressor will automatically be cloned each time prior to fitting.
        If regressor is ``None``, ``LinearRegression()`` is created and used.

    transformer : object, default=None
        Estimator object such as derived from ``TransformerMixin``. Cannot be
        set at the same time as ``func`` and ``inverse_func``. If
        ``transformer`` is ``None`` as well as ``func`` and ``inverse_func``,
        the transformer will be an identity transformer. Note that the
        transformer will be cloned during fitting. Also, the transformer is
        restricting ``y`` to be a numpy array.

    func : function, default=None
        Function to apply to ``y`` before passing to ``fit``. Cannot be set at
        the same time as ``transformer``. The function needs to return a
        2-dimensional array. If ``func`` is ``None``, the function used will be
        the identity function.

    inverse_func : function, default=None
        Function to apply to the prediction of the regressor. Cannot be set at
        the same time as ``transformer`` as well. The function needs to return
        a 2-dimensional array. The inverse function is used to return
        predictions to the same space of the original training labels.

    check_inverse : bool, default=True
        Whether to check that ``transform`` followed by ``inverse_transform``
        or ``func`` followed by ``inverse_func`` leads to the original targets.

    Attributes
    ----------
    regressor_ : object
        Fitted regressor.

    transformer_ : object
        Transformer used in ``fit`` and ``predict``.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
    >>> from sklearn.compose import TransformedTargetRegressor
    >>> tt = TransformedTargetRegressor(regressor=LinearRegression(),
    ...                                 func=np.log, inverse_func=np.exp)
    >>> X = np.arange(4).reshape(-1, 1)
    >>> y = np.exp(2 * X).ravel()
    >>> tt.fit(X, y)
    TransformedTargetRegressor(...)
    >>> tt.score(X, y)
    1.0
    >>> tt.regressor_.coef_
    array([2.])

    Notes
    -----
    Internally, the target ``y`` is always converted into a 2-dimensional array
    to be used by scikit-learn transformers. At the time of prediction, the
    output will be reshaped to a have the same number of dimensions as ``y``.

    See :ref:`examples/compose/plot_transformed_target.py
    <sphx_glr_auto_examples_compose_plot_transformed_target.py>`.
