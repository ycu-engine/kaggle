        Returns indices of and distances to the neighbors of each point.

        Parameters
        ----------
        X : array-like, shape (n_queries, n_features), \
            or (n_queries, n_indexed) if metric == 'precomputed', \
                default=None
            The query point or points.
            If not provided, neighbors of each indexed point are returned.
            In this case, the query point is not considered its own neighbor.

        n_neighbors : int, default=None
            Number of neighbors required for each sample. The default is the
            value passed to the constructor.

        return_distance : bool, default=True
            Whether or not to return the distances.

        Returns
        -------
        neigh_dist : ndarray of shape (n_queries, n_neighbors)
            Array representing the lengths to points, only present if
            return_distance=True

        neigh_ind : ndarray of shape (n_queries, n_neighbors)
            Indices of the nearest points in the population matrix.

        Examples
        --------
        In the following example, we construct a NearestNeighbors
        class from an array representing our data set and ask who's
        the closest point to [1,1,1]

        >>> samples = [[0., 0., 0.], [0., .5, 0.], [1., 1., .5]]

        >>> print(neigh.kneighbors([[1., 1., 1.]]))
        (array([[0.5]]), array([[2]]))

        As you can see, it returns [[0.5]], and [[2]], which means that the
        element is at distance 0.5 and is the third element of samples
        (indexes start at 0). You can also query for multiple points:

        >>> X = [[0., 1., 0.], [1., 0., 1.]]
        >>> neigh.kneighbors(X, return_distance=False)

                default=None

            If not provided, neighbors of each indexed point are returned.
            In this case, the query point is not considered its own neighbor.
            For ``metric='precomputed'`` the shape should be
            (n_queries, n_indexed). Otherwise the shape should be
            (n_queries, n_features).

        n_neighbors : int, default=None
            Number of neighbors for each sample. The default is the value
            passed to the constructor.

        mode : {'connectivity', 'distance'}, default='connectivity'
            Type of returned matrix: 'connectivity' will return the
            connectivity matrix with ones and zeros, in 'distance' the
            edges are Euclidean distance between points.

        Returns
        -------
        A : sparse-matrix of shape (n_queries, n_samples_fit)
            `n_samples_fit` is the number of samples in the fitted data
            `A[i, j]` is assigned the weight of edge that connects `i` to `j`.
            The matrix is of CSR format.

        Examples
        --------

        Return the indices and distances of each point from the dataset
        lying in a ball with size ``radius`` around the points of the query
        array. Points lying on the boundary are included in the results.

        The result points are *not* necessarily sorted by distance to their
        query point.

        Parameters
        ----------
        X : array-like of (n_samples, n_features), default=None
            The query point or points.
            If not provided, neighbors of each indexed point are returned.
            In this case, the query point is not considered its own neighbor.

        radius : float, default=None

        return_distance : bool, default=True
            Whether or not to return the distances.

        sort_results : bool, default=False
            If True, the distances and indices will be sorted by increasing
            distances before being returned. If False, the results may not
            be sorted. If `return_distance=False`, setting `sort_results=True`
            will result in an error.

            .. versionadded:: 0.22

        Returns
        -------
        neigh_dist : ndarray of shape (n_samples,) of arrays
            Array representing the distances to each point, only present if
            `return_distance=True`. The distance values are computed according
            to the ``metric`` constructor parameter.

        neigh_ind : ndarray of shape (n_samples,) of arrays
            An array of arrays of indices of the approximate nearest points
            from the population matrix that lie within a ball of size
            ``radius`` around the query points.

        Examples
        --------
        In the following example, we construct a NeighborsClassifier
        class from an array representing our data set and ask who's
        the closest point to [1, 1, 1]:

        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> samples = [[0., 0., 0.], [0., .5, 0.], [1., 1., .5]]
        >>> from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors
        >>> neigh = NearestNeighbors(radius=1.6)
        >>> neigh.fit(samples)
        NearestNeighbors(radius=1.6)
        >>> rng = neigh.radius_neighbors([[1., 1., 1.]])
        >>> print(np.asarray(rng[0][0]))
        [1.5 0.5]
        >>> print(np.asarray(rng[1][0]))
        [1 2]

        The first array returned contains the distances to all points which
        are closer than 1.6, while the second array returned contains their
        indices.  In general, multiple points can be queried at the same time.

        Notes
        -----
        Because the number of neighbors of each point is not necessarily
        equal, the results for multiple query points cannot be fit in a
        standard data array.
        For efficiency, `radius_neighbors` returns arrays of objects, where
        each object is a 1D array of indices or distances.
