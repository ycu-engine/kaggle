    The optimization objective for the case method='lasso' is::

    (1 / (2 * n_samples)) * ||y - Xw||^2_2 + alpha * ||w||_1

    in the case of method='lars', the objective function is only known in
    the form of an implicit equation (see discussion in [1])

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <least_angle_regression>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : None or array-like of shape (n_samples, n_features)
        Input data. Note that if X is None then the Gram matrix must be
        specified, i.e., cannot be None or False.

    y : None or array-like of shape (n_samples,)
        Input targets.

    Xy : array-like of shape (n_samples,) or (n_samples, n_targets), \
            default=None
        Xy = np.dot(X.T, y) that can be precomputed. It is useful
        only when the Gram matrix is precomputed.

    Gram : None, 'auto', array-like of shape (n_features, n_features), \
            default=None
        Precomputed Gram matrix (X' * X), if ``'auto'``, the Gram
        matrix is precomputed from the given X, if there are more samples
        than features.

    max_iter : int, default=500
        Maximum number of iterations to perform, set to infinity for no limit.

    alpha_min : float, default=0
        Minimum correlation along the path. It corresponds to the
        regularization parameter alpha parameter in the Lasso.

    method : {'lar', 'lasso'}, default='lar'
        Specifies the returned model. Select ``'lar'`` for Least Angle
        Regression, ``'lasso'`` for the Lasso.

    copy_X : bool, default=True
        If ``False``, ``X`` is overwritten.

    eps : float, default=np.finfo(float).eps
        The machine-precision regularization in the computation of the
        Cholesky diagonal factors. Increase this for very ill-conditioned
        systems. Unlike the ``tol`` parameter in some iterative
        optimization-based algorithms, this parameter does not control
        the tolerance of the optimization.

    copy_Gram : bool, default=True
        If ``False``, ``Gram`` is overwritten.

    verbose : int, default=0
        Controls output verbosity.

    return_path : bool, default=True
        If ``return_path==True`` returns the entire path, else returns only the
        last point of the path.

    return_n_iter : bool, default=False
        Whether to return the number of iterations.

    positive : bool, default=False
        Restrict coefficients to be >= 0.
        This option is only allowed with method 'lasso'. Note that the model
        coefficients will not converge to the ordinary-least-squares solution
        for small values of alpha. Only coefficients up to the smallest alpha
        value (``alphas_[alphas_ > 0.].min()`` when fit_path=True) reached by
        the stepwise Lars-Lasso algorithm are typically in congruence with the
        solution of the coordinate descent lasso_path function.

    Returns
    -------
    alphas : array-like of shape (n_alphas + 1,)
        Maximum of covariances (in absolute value) at each iteration.
        ``n_alphas`` is either ``max_iter``, ``n_features`` or the
        number of nodes in the path with ``alpha >= alpha_min``, whichever
        is smaller.

    active : array-like of shape (n_alphas,)
        Indices of active variables at the end of the path.

    coefs : array-like of shape (n_features, n_alphas + 1)
        Coefficients along the path

    n_iter : int
        Number of iterations run. Returned only if return_n_iter is set
        to True.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <least_angle_regression>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fit_intercept : bool, default=True
        whether to calculate the intercept for this model. If set
        to false, no intercept will be used in calculations
        (i.e. data is expected to be centered).

    verbose : bool or int, default=False
        Sets the verbosity amount.

    max_iter : int, default=500
        Maximum number of iterations to perform.

    normalize : bool, default=True
        This parameter is ignored when ``fit_intercept`` is set to False.
        If True, the regressors X will be normalized before regression by
        subtracting the mean and dividing by the l2-norm.
        If you wish to standardize, please use
        :class:`~sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler` before calling ``fit``
        on an estimator with ``normalize=False``.

    precompute : bool or 'auto' , default='auto'
        Whether to use a precomputed Gram matrix to speed up
        calculations. If set to ``'auto'`` let us decide. The Gram matrix
        cannot be passed as argument since we will use only subsets of X.

    cv : int, cross-validation generator or an iterable, default=None
        Determines the cross-validation splitting strategy.
        Possible inputs for cv are:

        - None, to use the default 5-fold cross-validation,
        - integer, to specify the number of folds.
        - :term:`CV splitter`,
        - An iterable yielding (train, test) splits as arrays of indices.

        For integer/None inputs, :class:`KFold` is used.

        Refer :ref:`User Guide <cross_validation>` for the various
        cross-validation strategies that can be used here.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.22
            ``cv`` default value if None changed from 3-fold to 5-fold.

    max_n_alphas : int, default=1000
        The maximum number of points on the path used to compute the
        residuals in the cross-validation

    n_jobs : int or None, default=None
        Number of CPUs to use during the cross validation.
        ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.
        ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>`
        for more details.

    eps : float, default=np.finfo(float).eps
        The machine-precision regularization in the computation of the
        Cholesky diagonal factors. Increase this for very ill-conditioned
        systems. Unlike the ``tol`` parameter in some iterative
        optimization-based algorithms, this parameter does not control
        the tolerance of the optimization.

    copy_X : bool, default=True
        If True, X will be copied; else, it may be overwritten.

    positive : bool, default=False
        Restrict coefficients to be >= 0. Be aware that you might want to
        remove fit_intercept which is set True by default.
        Under the positive restriction the model coefficients do not converge
        to the ordinary-least-squares solution for small values of alpha.
        Only coefficients up to the smallest alpha value (``alphas_[alphas_ >
        0.].min()`` when fit_path=True) reached by the stepwise Lars-Lasso
        algorithm are typically in congruence with the solution of the
        coordinate descent Lasso estimator.
        As a consequence using LassoLarsCV only makes sense for problems where
        a sparse solution is expected and/or reached.

    Notes
    -----

    The object solves the same problem as the LassoCV object. However,
    unlike the LassoCV, it find the relevant alphas values by itself.
    In general, because of this property, it will be more stable.
    However, it is more fragile to heavily multicollinear datasets.

    It is more efficient than the LassoCV if only a small number of
    features are selected compared to the total number, for instance if
    there are very few samples compared to the number of features.

    alphas_ : array-like of shape (n_alphas + 1,) or list of such arrays
        Maximum of covariances (in absolute value) at each iteration.
        ``n_alphas`` is either ``max_iter``, ``n_features`` or the
        number of nodes in the path with ``alpha >= alpha_min``, whichever

    n_iter_ : int
