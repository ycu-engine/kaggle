"""Caching loader for the 20 newsgroups text classification dataset.


The description of the dataset is available on the official website at:

    http://people.csail.mit.edu/jrennie/20Newsgroups/

Quoting the introduction:

    The 20 Newsgroups data set is a collection of approximately 20,000
    newsgroup documents, partitioned (nearly) evenly across 20 different
    newsgroups. To the best of my knowledge, it was originally collected
    by Ken Lang, probably for his Newsweeder: Learning to filter netnews
    paper, though he does not explicitly mention this collection. The 20
    newsgroups collection has become a popular data set for experiments
    in text applications of machine learning techniques, such as text
    classification and text clustering.

This dataset loader will download the recommended "by date" variant of the
dataset and which features a point in time split between the train and
test sets. The compressed dataset size is around 14 Mb compressed. Once
uncompressed the train set is 52 MB and the test set is 34 MB.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data_home : str, default=None
        Specify a download and cache folder for the datasets. If None,
        all scikit-learn data is stored in '~/scikit_learn_data' subfolders.

    subset : {'train', 'test', 'all'}, default='train'
        Select the dataset to load: 'train' for the training set, 'test'
        for the test set, 'all' for both, with shuffled ordering.

    categories : array-like, dtype=str or unicode, default=None
        If None (default), load all the categories.
        If not None, list of category names to load (other categories
        ignored).

    shuffle : bool, default=True
        Whether or not to shuffle the data: might be important for models that
        make the assumption that the samples are independent and identically
        distributed (i.i.d.), such as stochastic gradient descent.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        Determines random number generation for dataset shuffling. Pass an int
        for reproducible output across multiple function calls.
        See :term:`Glossary <random_state>`.

    remove : tuple, default=()
        May contain any subset of ('headers', 'footers', 'quotes'). Each of
        these are kinds of text that will be detected and removed from the
        newsgroup posts, preventing classifiers from overfitting on
        metadata.

        'headers' removes newsgroup headers, 'footers' removes blocks at the
        ends of posts that look like signatures, and 'quotes' removes lines
        that appear to be quoting another post.

        'headers' follows an exact standard; the other filters are not always
        correct.

    download_if_missing : bool, default=True
        If False, raise an IOError if the data is not locally available
        instead of trying to download the data from the source site.

    return_X_y : bool, default=False
        If True, returns `(data.data, data.target)` instead of a Bunch
        object.

        .. versionadded:: 0.22

    Returns
    -------

            The data list to learn.
        target: ndarray of shape (n_samples,)
