    Partial dependence plots, individual conditional expectation plots or an
    overlay of both of them can be plotted by setting the ``kind``
    parameter.
    The ``len(features)`` plots are arranged in a grid with ``n_cols``
    columns. Two-way partial dependence plots are plotted as contour plots. The
    deciles of the feature values will be shown with tick marks on the x-axes
    for one-way plots, and on both axes for two-way plots.

    .. warning::

        For :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier` and
        :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor`, the
        `'recursion'` method (used by default) will not account for the `init`
        predictor of the boosting process. In practice, this will produce
        the same values as `'brute'` up to a constant offset in the target
        response, provided that `init` is a constant estimator (which is the
        default). However, if `init` is not a constant estimator, the
        partial dependence values are incorrect for `'recursion'` because the
        offset will be sample-dependent. It is preferable to use the `'brute'`
        method. Note that this only applies to
        :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier` and
        :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor`, not to
        :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.HistGradientBoostingClassifier` and
        :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.HistGradientBoostingRegressor`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    estimator : BaseEstimator
        A fitted estimator object implementing :term:`predict`,
        :term:`predict_proba`, or :term:`decision_function`.
        Multioutput-multiclass classifiers are not supported.

    X : {array-like or dataframe} of shape (n_samples, n_features)
        ``X`` is used to generate a grid of values for the target
        ``features`` (where the partial dependence will be evaluated), and
        also to generate values for the complement features when the
        `method` is `'brute'`.

    features : list of {int, str, pair of int, pair of str}
        The target features for which to create the PDPs.
        If `features[i]` is an integer or a string, a one-way PDP is created;
        if `features[i]` is a tuple, a two-way PDP is created (only supported
        with `kind='average'`). Each tuple must be of size 2.
        if any entry is a string, then it must be in ``feature_names``.

    feature_names : array-like of shape (n_features,), dtype=str, default=None
        Name of each feature; `feature_names[i]` holds the name of the feature
        with index `i`.
        By default, the name of the feature corresponds to their numerical
        index for NumPy array and their column name for pandas dataframe.

    target : int, default=None
        - In a multiclass setting, specifies the class for which the PDPs
          should be computed. Note that for binary classification, the
          positive class (index 1) is always used.
        - In a multioutput setting, specifies the task for which the PDPs
          should be computed.

        Ignored in binary classification or classical regression settings.

    response_method : {'auto', 'predict_proba', 'decision_function'}, \
            default='auto'
        Specifies whether to use :term:`predict_proba` or
        :term:`decision_function` as the target response. For regressors
        this parameter is ignored and the response is always the output of
        :term:`predict`. By default, :term:`predict_proba` is tried first
        and we revert to :term:`decision_function` if it doesn't exist. If
        ``method`` is `'recursion'`, the response is always the output of
        :term:`decision_function`.

    n_cols : int, default=3
        The maximum number of columns in the grid plot. Only active when `ax`
        is a single axis or `None`.

    grid_resolution : int, default=100
        The number of equally spaced points on the axes of the plots, for each
        target feature.

    percentiles : tuple of float, default=(0.05, 0.95)
        The lower and upper percentile used to create the extreme values
        for the PDP axes. Must be in [0, 1].

    method : str, default='auto'
        The method used to calculate the averaged predictions:

        - `'recursion'` is only supported for some tree-based estimators
          (namely
          :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier`,
          :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor`,
          :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.HistGradientBoostingClassifier`,
          :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.HistGradientBoostingRegressor`,
          :class:`~sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor`,
          :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor`
          but is more efficient in terms of speed.
          With this method, the target response of a
          classifier is always the decision function, not the predicted
          probabilities. Since the `'recursion'` method implicitely computes
          the average of the ICEs by design, it is not compatible with ICE and
          thus `kind` must be `'average'`.

        - `'brute'` is supported for any estimator, but is more
          computationally intensive.

        - `'auto'`: the `'recursion'` is used for estimators that support it,
          and `'brute'` is used otherwise.

        Please see :ref:`this note <pdp_method_differences>` for
        differences between the `'brute'` and `'recursion'` method.

    n_jobs : int, default=None
        The number of CPUs to use to compute the partial dependences.
        ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.
        ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>`
        for more details.

    verbose : int, default=0
        Verbose output during PD computations.

    line_kw : dict, default=None
        Dict with keywords passed to the ``matplotlib.pyplot.plot`` call.
        For one-way partial dependence plots.

    contour_kw : dict, default=None
        Dict with keywords passed to the ``matplotlib.pyplot.contourf`` call.
        For two-way partial dependence plots.

    ax : Matplotlib axes or array-like of Matplotlib axes, default=None
        - If a single axis is passed in, it is treated as a bounding axes
          and a grid of partial dependence plots will be drawn within
          these bounds. The `n_cols` parameter controls the number of
          columns in the grid.
        - If an array-like of axes are passed in, the partial dependence
          plots will be drawn directly into these axes.
        - If `None`, a figure and a bounding axes is created and treated
          as the single axes case.

        .. versionadded:: 0.22

    kind : {'average', 'individual', 'both'}, default='average'
        Whether to plot the partial dependence averaged across all the samples
        in the dataset or one line per sample or both.

        - ``kind='average'`` results in the traditional PD plot;
        - ``kind='individual'`` results in the ICE plot.

       Note that the fast ``method='recursion'`` option is only available for
       ``kind='average'``. Plotting individual dependencies requires using the
       slower ``method='brute'`` option.

        .. versionadded:: 0.24

    subsample : float, int or None, default=1000
        Sampling for ICE curves when `kind` is 'individual' or 'both'.
        If `float`, should be between 0.0 and 1.0 and represent the proportion
        of the dataset to be used to plot ICE curves. If `int`, represents the
        absolute number samples to use.

        Note that the full dataset is still used to calculate averaged partial
        dependence when `kind='both'`.

        .. versionadded:: 0.24

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        Controls the randomness of the selected samples when subsamples is not
        `None` and `kind` is either `'both'` or `'individual'`.
        See :term:`Glossary <random_state>` for details.
