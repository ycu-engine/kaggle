    """Evaluate metric(s) by cross-validation and also record fit/score times.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <multimetric_cross_validation>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    estimator : estimator object implementing 'fit'
        The object to use to fit the data.

    X : array-like of shape (n_samples, n_features)
        The data to fit. Can be for example a list, or an array.

    y : array-like of shape (n_samples,) or (n_samples, n_outputs), \
            default=None
        The target variable to try to predict in the case of
        supervised learning.

    groups : array-like of shape (n_samples,), default=None
        Group labels for the samples used while splitting the dataset into
        train/test set. Only used in conjunction with a "Group" :term:`cv`
        instance (e.g., :class:`GroupKFold`).

    scoring : str, callable, list/tuple, or dict, default=None
        A single str (see :ref:`scoring_parameter`) or a callable
        (see :ref:`scoring`) to evaluate the predictions on the test set.

        For evaluating multiple metrics, either give a list of (unique) strings
        or a dict with names as keys and callables as values.

        NOTE that when using custom scorers, each scorer should return a single
        value. Metric functions returning a list/array of values can be wrapped
        into multiple scorers that return one value each.

        See :ref:`multimetric_grid_search` for an example.

        If None, the estimator's score method is used.

    cv : int, cross-validation generator or an iterable, default=None
        Determines the cross-validation splitting strategy.
        Possible inputs for cv are:

        - None, to use the default 5-fold cross validation,
        - int, to specify the number of folds in a `(Stratified)KFold`,
        - :term:`CV splitter`,
        - An iterable yielding (train, test) splits as arrays of indices.

        For int/None inputs, if the estimator is a classifier and ``y`` is
        either binary or multiclass, :class:`StratifiedKFold` is used. In all
        other cases, :class:`KFold` is used.

        Refer :ref:`User Guide <cross_validation>` for the various
        cross-validation strategies that can be used here.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.22
            ``cv`` default value if None changed from 3-fold to 5-fold.

    n_jobs : int, default=None
        Number of jobs to run in parallel. Training the estimator and computing
        the score are parallelized over the cross-validation splits.
        ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.
        ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>`
        for more details.

    verbose : int, default=0
        The verbosity level.

    fit_params : dict, default=None
        Parameters to pass to the fit method of the estimator.

    pre_dispatch : int or str, default='2*n_jobs'
        Controls the number of jobs that get dispatched during parallel
        execution. Reducing this number can be useful to avoid an
        explosion of memory consumption when more jobs get dispatched
        than CPUs can process. This parameter can be:

            - None, in which case all the jobs are immediately
              created and spawned. Use this for lightweight and
              fast-running jobs, to avoid delays due to on-demand
              spawning of the jobs

            - An int, giving the exact number of total jobs that are
              spawned

            - A str, giving an expression as a function of n_jobs,
              as in '2*n_jobs'

    return_train_score : bool, default=False
        Whether to include train scores.
        Computing training scores is used to get insights on how different
        parameter settings impact the overfitting/underfitting trade-off.
        However computing the scores on the training set can be computationally
        expensive and is not strictly required to select the parameters that
        yield the best generalization performance.

        .. versionadded:: 0.19

        .. versionchanged:: 0.21
            Default value was changed from ``True`` to ``False``

    return_estimator : bool, default=False
        Whether to return the estimators fitted on each split.

        .. versionadded:: 0.20

    error_score : 'raise' or numeric, default=np.nan
        Value to assign to the score if an error occurs in estimator fitting.
        If set to 'raise', the error is raised.
        If a numeric value is given, FitFailedWarning is raised.

        .. versionadded:: 0.20

    Returns
    -------
    scores : dict of float arrays of shape (n_splits,)
        Array of scores of the estimator for each run of the cross validation.

        A dict of arrays containing the score/time arrays for each scorer is
        returned. The possible keys for this ``dict`` are:

            ``test_score``
                The score array for test scores on each cv split.
                Suffix ``_score`` in ``test_score`` changes to a specific
                metric like ``test_r2`` or ``test_auc`` if there are
                multiple scoring metrics in the scoring parameter.
            ``train_score``
                The score array for train scores on each cv split.
                Suffix ``_score`` in ``train_score`` changes to a specific
                metric like ``train_r2`` or ``train_auc`` if there are
                multiple scoring metrics in the scoring parameter.
                This is available only if ``return_train_score`` parameter
                is ``True``.
            ``fit_time``
                The time for fitting the estimator on the train
                set for each cv split.
            ``score_time``
                The time for scoring the estimator on the test set for each
                cv split. (Note time for scoring on the train set is not
                included even if ``return_train_score`` is set to ``True``
            ``estimator``
                The estimator objects for each cv split.
                This is available only if ``return_estimator`` parameter
                is set to ``True``.

    Notes
    -----
    In the case that one or more classes are absent in a training portion, a
    default score needs to be assigned to all instances for that class if
    ``method`` produces columns per class, as in {'decision_function',
    'predict_proba', 'predict_log_proba'}.  For ``predict_proba`` this value is
    0.  In order to ensure finite output, we approximate negative infinity by
    the minimum finite float value for the dtype in other cases.

    n_jobs : int, default=None
        Number of jobs to run in parallel. Training the estimator and computing

        Where C is the number of permutations whose score >= the true score.

        The best possible p-value is 1/(n_permutations + 1), the worst is 1.0.

    """Learning curve.

    Determines cross-validated training and test scores for different training
    set sizes.

    A cross-validation generator splits the whole dataset k times in training
    and test data. Subsets of the training set with varying sizes will be used
    to train the estimator and a score for each training subset size and the
    test set will be computed. Afterwards, the scores will be averaged over
    all k runs for each training subset size.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <learning_curve>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    estimator : object type that implements the "fit" and "predict" methods
        An object of that type which is cloned for each validation.

    X : array-like of shape (n_samples, n_features)
        Training vector, where n_samples is the number of samples and
        n_features is the number of features.

    y : array-like of shape (n_samples,) or (n_samples, n_outputs)
        Target relative to X for classification or regression;
        None for unsupervised learning.

    groups : array-like of  shape (n_samples,), default=None
        Group labels for the samples used while splitting the dataset into
        train/test set. Only used in conjunction with a "Group" :term:`cv`
        instance (e.g., :class:`GroupKFold`).

    train_sizes : array-like of shape (n_ticks,), \
            default=np.linspace(0.1, 1.0, 5)
        Relative or absolute numbers of training examples that will be used to
        generate the learning curve. If the dtype is float, it is regarded as a
        fraction of the maximum size of the training set (that is determined
        by the selected validation method), i.e. it has to be within (0, 1].
        Otherwise it is interpreted as absolute sizes of the training sets.
        Note that for classification the number of samples usually have to
        be big enough to contain at least one sample from each class.

    cv : int, cross-validation generator or an iterable, default=None
        Determines the cross-validation splitting strategy.
        Possible inputs for cv are:

        - None, to use the default 5-fold cross validation,
        - int, to specify the number of folds in a `(Stratified)KFold`,
        - :term:`CV splitter`,
        - An iterable yielding (train, test) splits as arrays of indices.

        For int/None inputs, if the estimator is a classifier and ``y`` is
        either binary or multiclass, :class:`StratifiedKFold` is used. In all
        other cases, :class:`KFold` is used.

        Refer :ref:`User Guide <cross_validation>` for the various
        cross-validation strategies that can be used here.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.22
            ``cv`` default value if None changed from 3-fold to 5-fold.

    scoring : str or callable, default=None
        A str (see model evaluation documentation) or
        a scorer callable object / function with signature
        ``scorer(estimator, X, y)``.

    exploit_incremental_learning : bool, default=False
        If the estimator supports incremental learning, this will be
        used to speed up fitting for different training set sizes.

    n_jobs : int, default=None
        Number of jobs to run in parallel. Training the estimator and computing
        the score are parallelized over the different training and test sets.
        ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.
        ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>`
        for more details.

    pre_dispatch : int or str, default='all'
        Number of predispatched jobs for parallel execution (default is
        all). The option can reduce the allocated memory. The str can
        be an expression like '2*n_jobs'.

    verbose : int, default=0
        Controls the verbosity: the higher, the more messages.

    shuffle : bool, default=False
        Whether to shuffle training data before taking prefixes of it
        based on``train_sizes``.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        Used when ``shuffle`` is True. Pass an int for reproducible
        output across multiple function calls.
        See :term:`Glossary <random_state>`.

    error_score : 'raise' or numeric, default=np.nan
        Value to assign to the score if an error occurs in estimator fitting.
        If set to 'raise', the error is raised.
        If a numeric value is given, FitFailedWarning is raised.

        .. versionadded:: 0.20

    return_times : bool, default=False
        Whether to return the fit and score times.

    fit_params : dict, default=None
        Parameters to pass to the fit method of the estimator.

        .. versionadded:: 0.24

    Returns
    -------
    train_sizes_abs : array of shape (n_unique_ticks,)
        Numbers of training examples that has been used to generate the
        learning curve. Note that the number of ticks might be less
        than n_ticks because duplicate entries will be removed.

    train_scores : array of shape (n_ticks, n_cv_folds)
        Scores on training sets.

    test_scores : array of shape (n_ticks, n_cv_folds)
        Scores on test set.

    fit_times : array of shape (n_ticks, n_cv_folds)
        Times spent for fitting in seconds. Only present if ``return_times``
        is True.

    score_times : array of shape (n_ticks, n_cv_folds)
        Times spent for scoring in seconds. Only present if ``return_times``
        is True.
