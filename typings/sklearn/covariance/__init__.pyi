"""
The :mod:`sklearn.covariance` module includes methods and algorithms to
robustly estimate the covariance of features given a set of points. The
precision matrix defined as the inverse of the covariance is also estimated.
Covariance estimation is closely related to the theory of Gaussian Graphical
Models.
