A collection of image utilities using the Python Imaging Library (PIL).

This is a local version of utility functions from scipy that are wrapping PIL
functionality. These functions are deprecated in scipy 1.0.0 and will be
removed in scipy 1.2.0. Therefore, the functionality used in sklearn is copied
here. This file is taken from scipy/misc/pilutil.py in scipy
1.0.0. Modifications include: making this module importable if pillow is not
installed, removal of DeprecationWarning, removal of functions scikit-learn
does not need.

def bytescale(data, cmin=..., cmax=..., high=..., low=...):
    """
    Byte scales an array (image).

    Byte scaling means converting the input image to uint8 dtype and scaling
    the range to ``(low, high)`` (default 0-255).
    If the input image already has dtype uint8, no scaling is done.

    This function is only available if Python Imaging Library (PIL) is installed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : ndarray
        PIL image data array.
    cmin : scalar, default=None
        Bias scaling of small values. Default is ``data.min()``.
    cmax : scalar, default=None
        Bias scaling of large values. Default is ``data.max()``.
    high : scalar, default=None
        Scale max value to `high`.  Default is 255.
    low : scalar, default=None
        Scale min value to `low`.  Default is 0.

    Returns
    -------
    img_array : uint8 ndarray
        The byte-scaled array.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from scipy.misc import bytescale
    >>> img = np.array([[ 91.06794177,   3.39058326,  84.4221549 ],
    ...                 [ 73.88003259,  80.91433048,   4.88878881],
    ...                 [ 51.53875334,  34.45808177,  27.5873488 ]])
    >>> bytescale(img)
    array([[255,   0, 236],
           [205, 225,   4],
           [140,  90,  70]], dtype=uint8)

    array([[200, 100, 192],
           [180, 188, 102],
           [155, 135, 128]], dtype=uint8)
    >>> bytescale(img, cmin=0, cmax=255)

def imread(name, flatten=..., mode=...):
    """
    Read an image from a file as an array.

    This function is only available if Python Imaging Library (PIL) is installed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name : str or file object
        The file name or file object to be read.
    flatten : bool, default=False
        If True, flattens the color layers into a single gray-scale layer.
    mode : str, default=None
        Mode to convert image to, e.g. ``'RGB'``.  See the Notes for more
        details.

    Returns
    -------
    imread : ndarray
        The array obtained by reading the image.

    Notes
    -----
    `imread` uses the Python Imaging Library (PIL) to read an image.
    The following notes are from the PIL documentation.

    `mode` can be one of the following strings:

    * 'L' (8-bit pixels, black and white)
    * 'P' (8-bit pixels, mapped to any other mode using a color palette)
    * 'RGB' (3x8-bit pixels, true color)
    * 'RGBA' (4x8-bit pixels, true color with transparency mask)
    * 'CMYK' (4x8-bit pixels, color separation)
    * 'YCbCr' (3x8-bit pixels, color video format)
    * 'I' (32-bit signed integer pixels)
    * 'F' (32-bit floating point pixels)

    PIL also provides limited support for a few special modes, including
    'LA' ('L' with alpha), 'RGBX' (true color with padding) and 'RGBa'
    (true color with premultiplied alpha).

    When translating a color image to black and white (mode 'L', 'I' or
    'F'), the library uses the ITU-R 601-2 luma transform::

        L = R * 299/1000 + G * 587/1000 + B * 114/1000

    When `flatten` is True, the image is converted using mode 'F'.
    When `mode` is not None and `flatten` is True, the image is first
    converted according to `mode`, and the result is then flattened using
    mode 'F'.

def imsave(name, arr, format=...):
    """
    Save an array as an image.

    This function is only available if Python Imaging Library (PIL) is installed.

    .. warning::

        This function uses `bytescale` under the hood to rescale images to use
        the full (0, 255) range if ``mode`` is one of ``None, 'L', 'P', 'l'``.
        It will also cast data for 2-D images to ``uint32`` for ``mode=None``
        (which is the default).

    Parameters
    ----------
    name : str or file object
        Output file name or file object.
    arr : ndarray, MxN or MxNx3 or MxNx4
        Array containing image values.  If the shape is ``MxN``, the array
        represents a grey-level image.  Shape ``MxNx3`` stores the red, green
        and blue bands along the last dimension.  An alpha layer may be
        included, specified as the last colour band of an ``MxNx4`` array.
    format : str, default=None
        Image format. If omitted, the format to use is determined from the
        file name extension. If a file object was used instead of a file name,
        this parameter should always be used.

    Examples
    --------
    Construct an array of gradient intensity values and save to file:

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from scipy.misc import imsave
    >>> x = np.zeros((255, 255))
    >>> x = np.zeros((255, 255), dtype=np.uint8)
    >>> x[:] = np.arange(255)
    >>> imsave('gradient.png', x)

    Construct an array with three colour bands (R, G, B) and store to file:

    >>> rgb = np.zeros((255, 255, 3), dtype=np.uint8)
    >>> rgb[..., 0] = np.arange(255)
    >>> rgb[..., 1] = 55
    >>> rgb[..., 2] = 1 - np.arange(255)
    >>> imsave('rgb_gradient.png', rgb)

def fromimage(im, flatten=..., mode=...):

    Parameters
    ----------
    im : PIL image
        Input image.
    flatten : bool, default=False
        If true, convert the output to grey-scale.
    mode : str, default=None
        Mode to convert image to, e.g. ``'RGB'``.  See the Notes of the
        `imread` docstring for more details.

    Returns
    -------
    fromimage : ndarray
        The different colour bands/channels are stored in the

        RGB-image MxNx3 and an RGBA-image MxNx4.

    This function is only available if Python Imaging Library (PIL) is installed.

    The mode of the PIL image depends on the array shape and the `pal` and

    For 2-D arrays, if `pal` is a valid (N,3) byte-array giving the RGB values
    (from 0 to 255) then ``mode='P'``, otherwise ``mode='L'``, unless mode
    is given as 'F' or 'I' in which case a float and/or integer array is made.

    Notes
    -----
    For 3-D arrays, the `channel_axis` argument tells which dimension of the
    array holds the channel data.

    For 3-D arrays if one of the dimensions is 3, the mode is 'RGB'
    by default or 'YCbCr' if selected.

    The numpy array must be either 2 dimensional or 3 dimensional.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray

    size : int, float or tuple
        * int   - Percentage of current size.
        * float - Fraction of current size.
        * tuple - Size of the output image (height, width).

    interp : str, default='bilinear'
        Interpolation to use for re-sizing ('nearest', 'lanczos', 'bilinear',
        'bicubic' or 'cubic').
    mode : str, default=None
        The PIL image mode ('P', 'L', etc.) to convert `arr` before resizing.
        If ``mode=None`` (the default), 2-D images will be treated like
        ``mode='L'``, i.e. casting to long integer.  For 3-D and 4-D arrays,
