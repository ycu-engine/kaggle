    This function computes Cohen's kappa [1]_, a score that expresses the level
    of agreement between two annotators on a classification problem. It is
    defined as

    .. math::
        \kappa = (p_o - p_e) / (1 - p_e)

    where :math:`p_o` is the empirical probability of agreement on the label
    assigned to any sample (the observed agreement ratio), and :math:`p_e` is
    the expected agreement when both annotators assign labels randomly.
    :math:`p_e` is estimated using a per-annotator empirical prior over the
    class labels [2]_.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <cohen_kappa>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    y1 : array of shape (n_samples,)
        Labels assigned by the first annotator.

    y2 : array of shape (n_samples,)
        Labels assigned by the second annotator. The kappa statistic is
        symmetric, so swapping ``y1`` and ``y2`` doesn't change the value.

    labels : array-like of shape (n_classes,), default=None
        List of labels to index the matrix. This may be used to select a
        subset of labels. If None, all labels that appear at least once in
        ``y1`` or ``y2`` are used.

    weights : {'linear', 'quadratic'}, default=None
        Weighting type to calculate the score. None means no weighted;
        "linear" means linear weighted; "quadratic" means quadratic weighted.

    sample_weight : array-like of shape (n_samples,), default=None
        Sample weights.

    Returns
    -------
    kappa : float
        The kappa statistic, which is a number between -1 and 1. The maximum
        value means complete agreement; zero or lower means chance agreement.

        Ground truth (correct) labels.

    y_pred : 1d array-like, or label indicator array / sparse matrix
        Predicted labels, as returned by a classifier.

    labels : array-like of shape (n_classes,), default=None
        The set of labels to include when ``average != 'binary'``, and their
        order if ``average is None``. Labels present in the data can be
        excluded, for example to calculate a multiclass average ignoring a
        majority negative class, while labels not present in the data will

        labels are column indices. By default, all labels in ``y_true`` and
        ``y_pred`` are used in sorted order.

    pos_label : str or int, default=1
        The class to report if ``average='binary'`` and the data is binary.
        If the data are multiclass or multilabel, this will be ignored;
        setting ``labels=[pos_label]`` and ``average != 'binary'`` will report
        scores for that label only.

    average : {None, 'micro', 'macro', 'samples', 'weighted', \
            'binary'}, default='binary'
        If ``None``, the scores for each class are returned. Otherwise, this
        determines the type of averaging performed on the data:

        ``'binary'``:
            Only report results for the class specified by ``pos_label``.
            This is applicable only if targets (``y_{true,pred}``) are binary.
        ``'micro'``:
            Calculate metrics globally by counting the total true positives,
            false negatives and false positives.
        ``'macro'``:
            Calculate metrics for each label, and find their unweighted
            mean.  This does not take label imbalance into account.
        ``'weighted'``:
            Calculate metrics for each label, and find their average, weighted
            by support (the number of true instances for each label). This
            alters 'macro' to account for label imbalance.
        ``'samples'``:
            Calculate metrics for each instance, and find their average (only
            meaningful for multilabel classification).

    sample_weight : array-like of shape (n_samples,), default=None
        Sample weights.

    zero_division : "warn", {0.0, 1.0}, default="warn"
        Sets the value to return when there is a zero division, i.e. when there
        there are no negative values in predictions and labels. If set to
        "warn", this acts like 0, but a warning is also raised.

    :func:`jaccard_score` may be a poor metric if there are no

    sample_weight : array-like of shape (n_samples,), default=None
        Sample weights.

    zero_division : "warn", 0 or 1, default="warn"
        Sets the value to return when there is a zero division, i.e. when all
        predictions and labels are negative. If set to "warn", this acts as 0,
        but warnings are also raised.

    warn_for : tuple or set, for internal use

        function is being used to return only one of its metrics.

    sample_weight : array-like of shape (n_samples,), default=None
        Sample weights.

    zero_division : "warn", 0 or 1, default="warn"

        This parameter is required for multiclass/multilabel targets.
        If ``None``, the scores for each class are returned. Otherwise, this
        determines the type of averaging performed on the data:

        ``'binary'``:
            Only report results for the class specified by ``pos_label``.
            This is applicable only if targets (``y_{true,pred}``) are binary.
        ``'micro'``:
            Calculate metrics globally by counting the total true positives,
            false negatives and false positives.
        ``'macro'``:
            Calculate metrics for each label, and find their unweighted
            mean.  This does not take label imbalance into account.
        ``'weighted'``:
            Calculate metrics for each label, and find their average weighted
            by support (the number of true instances for each label). This
            alters 'macro' to account for label imbalance; it can result in an
            F-score that is not between precision and recall.
        ``'samples'``:
            Calculate metrics for each instance, and find their average (only
            meaningful for multilabel classification where this differs from
            :func:`accuracy_score`).

    sample_weight : array-like of shape (n_samples,), default=None
        Sample weights.

    zero_division : "warn", 0 or 1, default="warn"
        Sets the value to return when there is a zero division. If set to
        "warn", this acts as 0, but warnings are also raised.

    Returns
    -------
    recall : float (if average is not None) or array of float of shape
        (n_unique_labels,)
        Recall of the positive class in binary classification or weighted
        average of the recall of each class for the multiclass task.

    Notes
    -----
    When ``true positive + false negative == 0``, recall returns 0 and raises
    ``UndefinedMetricWarning``. This behavior can be modified with
    ``zero_division``.

    Notes
    -----
    In multiclass classification, the Hamming loss corresponds to the Hamming
    distance between ``y_true`` and ``y_pred`` which is equivalent to the
    subset ``zero_one_loss`` function, when `normalize` parameter is set to
    True.

    In multilabel classification, the Hamming loss is different from the
    subset zero-one loss. The zero-one loss considers the entire set of labels
    for a given sample incorrect if it does not entirely match the true set of
    labels. Hamming loss is more forgiving in that it penalizes only the
    individual labels.

    The Hamming loss is upperbounded by the subset zero-one loss, when
    `normalize` parameter is set to True. It is always between 0 and 1,
    lower being better.

    This is the loss function used in (multinomial) logistic regression
    and extensions of it such as neural networks, defined as the negative
    log-likelihood of a logistic model that returns ``y_pred`` probabilities
    for its training data ``y_true``.
    The log loss is only defined for two or more labels.
    For a single sample with true label :math:`y \in \{0,1\}` and
    and a probability estimate :math:`p = \operatorname{Pr}(y = 1)`, the log
    loss is:

    y_pred : array-like of float, shape = (n_samples, n_classes) or (n_samples,)
        Predicted probabilities, as returned by a classifier's
        predict_proba method. If ``y_pred.shape = (n_samples,)``

        ordered alphabetically, as done by
        :class:`preprocessing.LabelBinarizer`.

    eps : float, default=1e-15
        Log loss is undefined for p=0 or p=1, so probabilities are

    sample_weight : array-like of shape (n_samples,), default=None
        Sample weights.

    labels : array-like, default=None
        If not provided, labels will be inferred from y_true. If ``labels``

    The smaller the Brier score loss, the better, hence the naming with "loss".
    The Brier score measures the mean squared difference between the predicted

    The Brier score is appropriate for binary and categorical outcomes that
