class VarianceThreshold(SelectorMixin, BaseEstimator):
    """Feature selector that removes all low-variance features.

    This feature selection algorithm looks only at the features (X), not the
    desired outputs (y), and can thus be used for unsupervised learning.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <variance_threshold>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    threshold : float, default=0
        Features with a training-set variance lower than this threshold will
        be removed. The default is to keep all features with non-zero variance,
        i.e. remove the features that have the same value in all samples.

    Attributes
    ----------
    variances_ : array, shape (n_features,)
        Variances of individual features.

    Notes
    -----
    Allows NaN in the input.
    Raises ValueError if no feature in X meets the variance threshold.

    Examples
    --------
    The following dataset has integer features, two of which are the same
    in every sample. These are removed with the default setting for threshold::

        >>> X = [[0, 2, 0, 3], [0, 1, 4, 3], [0, 1, 1, 3]]
        >>> selector = VarianceThreshold()
        >>> selector.fit_transform(X)
        array([[2, 0],
               [1, 4],
               [1, 1]])

    def __init__(self, threshold=...) -> None:
        ...
    
    def fit(self, X, y=...):
        """Learn empirical variances from X.

        Parameters
        ----------
        X : {array-like, sparse matrix}, shape (n_samples, n_features)
            Sample vectors from which to compute variances.

        y : any, default=None
            Ignored. This parameter exists only for compatibility with
            sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline.
