def f_oneway(*args):
    """Performs a 1-way ANOVA.

    The one-way ANOVA tests the null hypothesis that 2 or more groups have
    the same population mean. The test is applied to samples from two or
    more groups, possibly with differing sizes.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <univariate_feature_selection>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    *args : array-like, sparse matrices
        sample1, sample2... The sample measurements should be given as
        arguments.

    Returns
    -------
    F-value : float
        The computed F-value of the test.
    p-value : float
        The associated p-value from the F-distribution.

    Notes
    -----
    The ANOVA test has important assumptions that must be satisfied in order
    for the associated p-value to be valid.

    1. The samples are independent
    2. Each sample is from a normally distributed population
    3. The population standard deviations of the groups are all equal. This
       property is known as homoscedasticity.

    If these assumptions are not true for a given set of data, it may still be
    possible to use the Kruskal-Wallis H-test (`scipy.stats.kruskal`_) although
    with some loss of power.

    The algorithm is from Heiman[2], pp.394-7.

    See ``scipy.stats.f_oneway`` that should give the same results while
    being less efficient.

    This score can be used to select the n_features features with the
    highest values for the test chi-squared statistic from X, which must
    contain only non-negative features such as booleans or frequencies
    (e.g., term counts in document classification), relative to the classes.

    Recall that the chi-square test measures dependence between stochastic
    variables, so using this function "weeds out" the features that are the
    most likely to be independent of class and therefore irrelevant for
    classification.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : {array-like, sparse matrix} of shape (n_samples, n_features)

    Linear model for testing the individual effect of each of many regressors.
    This is a scoring function to be used in a feature selection procedure, not
    a free standing feature selection procedure.

    This is done in 2 steps:

    1. The correlation between each regressor and the target is computed,
       that is, ((X[:, i] - mean(X[:, i])) * (y - mean_y)) / (std(X[:, i]) *
       std(y)).
