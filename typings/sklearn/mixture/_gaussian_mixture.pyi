    Representation of a Gaussian mixture model probability distribution.
    This class allows to estimate the parameters of a Gaussian mixture
    distribution.

    .. versionadded:: 0.18

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_components : int, default=1
        The number of mixture components.

    covariance_type : {'full', 'tied', 'diag', 'spherical'}, default='full'
        String describing the type of covariance parameters to use.
        Must be one of:

        'full'
            each component has its own general covariance matrix
        'tied'
            all components share the same general covariance matrix
        'diag'
            each component has its own diagonal covariance matrix
        'spherical'
            each component has its own single variance

    tol : float, default=1e-3
        The convergence threshold. EM iterations will stop when the
        lower bound average gain is below this threshold.

    reg_covar : float, default=1e-6
        Non-negative regularization added to the diagonal of covariance.
        Allows to assure that the covariance matrices are all positive.

    max_iter : int, default=100
        The number of EM iterations to perform.

    n_init : int, default=1
        The number of initializations to perform. The best results are kept.

    init_params : {'kmeans', 'random'}, default='kmeans'
        The method used to initialize the weights, the means and the
        precisions.
        Must be one of::

            'kmeans' : responsibilities are initialized using kmeans.
            'random' : responsibilities are initialized randomly.

    weights_init : array-like of shape (n_components, ), default=None
        The user-provided initial weights.
        If it is None, weights are initialized using the `init_params` method.

    means_init : array-like of shape (n_components, n_features), default=None
        The user-provided initial means,
        If it is None, means are initialized using the `init_params` method.

    precisions_init : array-like, default=None
        The user-provided initial precisions (inverse of the covariance
        matrices).
        If it is None, precisions are initialized using the 'init_params'
        method.
        The shape depends on 'covariance_type'::

            (n_components,)                        if 'spherical',
            (n_features, n_features)               if 'tied',
            (n_components, n_features)             if 'diag',
            (n_components, n_features, n_features) if 'full'

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        Controls the random seed given to the method chosen to initialize the
        parameters (see `init_params`).
        In addition, it controls the generation of random samples from the
        fitted distribution (see the method `sample`).
        Pass an int for reproducible output across multiple function calls.
        See :term:`Glossary <random_state>`.

    warm_start : bool, default=False
        If 'warm_start' is True, the solution of the last fitting is used as
        initialization for the next call of fit(). This can speed up
        convergence when fit is called several times on similar problems.
        In that case, 'n_init' is ignored and only a single initialization
        occurs upon the first call.
        See :term:`the Glossary <warm_start>`.

    verbose : int, default=0
        Enable verbose output. If 1 then it prints the current
        initialization and each iteration step. If greater than 1 then
        it prints also the log probability and the time needed
        for each step.

    verbose_interval : int, default=10
        Number of iteration done before the next print.

    Attributes
    ----------
    weights_ : array-like of shape (n_components,)
        The weights of each mixture components.

    means_ : array-like of shape (n_components, n_features)
        The mean of each mixture component.

    covariances_ : array-like
        The covariance of each mixture component.
        The shape depends on `covariance_type`::

            (n_components,)                        if 'spherical',
            (n_features, n_features)               if 'tied',
            (n_components, n_features)             if 'diag',
            (n_components, n_features, n_features) if 'full'

    precisions_ : array-like
        The precision matrices for each component in the mixture. A precision
        matrix is the inverse of a covariance matrix. A covariance matrix is
        symmetric positive definite so the mixture of Gaussian can be
        equivalently parameterized by the precision matrices. Storing the
        precision matrices instead of the covariance matrices makes it more
        efficient to compute the log-likelihood of new samples at test time.
        The shape depends on `covariance_type`::

            (n_components,)                        if 'spherical',
            (n_features, n_features)               if 'tied',
            (n_components, n_features)             if 'diag',
            (n_components, n_features, n_features) if 'full'

    precisions_cholesky_ : array-like
        The cholesky decomposition of the precision matrices of each mixture
        component. A precision matrix is the inverse of a covariance matrix.
        A covariance matrix is symmetric positive definite so the mixture of
        Gaussian can be equivalently parameterized by the precision matrices.
        Storing the precision matrices instead of the covariance matrices makes
        it more efficient to compute the log-likelihood of new samples at test
        time. The shape depends on `covariance_type`::

            (n_components,)                        if 'spherical',
            (n_features, n_features)               if 'tied',
            (n_components, n_features)             if 'diag',
            (n_components, n_features, n_features) if 'full'

    converged_ : bool
        True when convergence was reached in fit(), False otherwise.

    n_iter_ : int
        Number of step used by the best fit of EM to reach the convergence.

    lower_bound_ : float
        Lower bound value on the log-likelihood (of the training data with
        respect to the model) of the best fit of EM.
