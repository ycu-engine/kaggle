        The method fits the model ``n_init`` times and sets the parameters with

        trial, the method iterates between E-step and M-step for ``max_iter``
        times until the change of likelihood or lower bound is less than
        ``tol``, otherwise, a ``ConvergenceWarning`` is raised.
        If ``warm_start`` is ``True``, then ``n_init`` is ignored and a single
        initialization is performed upon the first call. Upon consecutive
        calls, training starts where it left off.
